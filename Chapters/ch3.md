# SQL For Mere Morals 4th Ed

## Chapter 3: A Concise History of SQL

### The Origins of SQL
* Dr. Chamberlin in 1974: Structured English Query Language.
* SEQUEL -> SQL in around 1976-1977

### Early Vendor Implementations
* 1977, Relational Software make Oracle
* UC Berkeley make Ingres, which becomes PostGres

### "... And Then There Was a Standard"
* Many versions of SQL compete to become the standard
* ANSI attempts to define a least common denominator among the DBs
* ISO also makes its own standard
* The result is SQL/86

### Evolution of the ANSI/ISO Standard
* Critiques of SQL/86 included redundancy, lack of operators, and lack 
of referential integrity.
* SQL/92 was a landmark step forward for SQL, as it defined ways forward
* Other standards exist to address specific needs 
* The standards continue to evolve over time

### Commercial Implementations
* "Suffice it to say that SQL in commercial database systems is here to stay."

### What the Future Holds
* Work to be done in 2017 onward on SQL/MM, or the multimedia standard

### Why Should You Learn SQL?
* To work with relational databases and to understand what GUIs are doing
* SQL implementations aren't that different from each other, and you just
need to relearn the differences

### Which Version of SQL Does This Book Cover?
* Basic SQL that should translate to any version SQL
* Problems and solutions in Access 2016, SQL Server 2016, MySQL, and Postgre

### Summary
* SQL is a relational database language
* IBM and Oracle were instrumental to SQL's rise
* ANSI/ISO SQL standards were initially clunky, but have come a long way
* SQL will continue to be relevant so long as relational databases are
